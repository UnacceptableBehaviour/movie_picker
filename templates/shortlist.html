#               discovery to his colleague, Douglas Hall, but knowing someone is after him, the old man leaves a letter in the
#               computer generated parallel world his company has created (which looks like the 30's with seemingly real people

#               world the same night, and his colleague is suspected. Douglas discovers a bloody shirt in his bathroom and he
#               cannot recall what he was doing the night Fuller was murdered. He logs into the system in order to find the
#               letter, but has to confront the unexpected. The truth is harsher than he could ever imagine...::Danny
